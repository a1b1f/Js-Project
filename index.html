                <!-- <p> Health.</p> -->
                <p> “Health” in terms of definitions for humans means a state of the body that is totally free from any illness or injury. Being healthy should be a part of our lifestyle as a whole. Good health and a happy mind are priceless possessions that one can have. If one is healthy, he or she can always work on getting wealth, however, wealth without good health is useless.</p>

                <!-- <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p> -->
                <p>Health is not just about what you are eating or how you physically appear to be. It’s also about what you are displaying in your behaviour, manifesting in your thoughts and speaking in your words. In today’s era there is so much competition at every step in life where everyone wants to outperform the others, be it at school or office. Students start running this rat race since children where they fail to recognize the fact that their health comes first.</p>

                <p>One who does not have good mental health fails to maintain good physical strength and stamina. Only a stress-free headspace and the right frame of mind can lead to strong physical health. This combination makes it possible for us to see and feel the true eternal happiness which is intrinsic and arises from within. The endless and tiring pursuit of happiness often makes one forget that they also have to take care of their physical as well as mental health.</p>
